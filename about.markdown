This Pengfei Cheng is a second-year PhD student in Chemical and Biomolecular 
Engineering at Georgia Tech.
My research focus is around optimization theories with applications in chemical
industries.
I still have a hard time finding the best way to explain what I do specifically.

You can find my CV [here](/assets/CV.pdf).

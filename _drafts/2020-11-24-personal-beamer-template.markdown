title: Personal Beamer Template
---

I am not fully satisfied with the group PowerPoint/Beamer template, mostly 
because of the usage of Calibri: it just looks awful with awkward spacing 
and poor readability.
Another issue is the usage of GT golden/blue colors, which can get way too
tricky especially in the main text and math equations.
This motivates me to build a personal beamer template.
In particular, I am interested in modifying the Madrid theme with a color theme
related to GT.

# Some thoughts
- smaller font size
- footer with title, author, date?, page number
- no shadow
